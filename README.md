# Test Toolkit

Test Toolkit is a Dart package designed to provide developers with a comprehensive set of tools for writing effective 
unit tests. 

At the heart of this package lies the MockedFunction, a useful tool that empowers you to test function calls and 
effortlessly mock their results.

## Aim

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring the reliability and correctness of individual units 
of code. Test Toolkit takes this process to the next level by simplifying the testing of function calls and offering 
flexible mocking capabilities.

With Test Toolkit, you can easily create MockedFunctions to simulate function behavior, allowing you to focus on 
testing specific scenarios and edge cases. This enables you to isolate the code under test and verify its interactions 
with other components seamlessly.
